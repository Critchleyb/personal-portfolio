# My Personal Portfolio

This website is a standalone front end built using react.

For this site, i wanted to go with a simple web application type design, with most of the pages fitting into a single screens height for no scrolling, and a fixed sidebar navigation to move between the pages. The website is fully reactive and able to be viewed on all device types

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Editing The Projects Page

I am able to easily add or remove projects from the website by editing the projects array in the src > features > projects > project.tsx file.
